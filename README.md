# TUD_HPDN

This repo includes the report and the code of the course **High Performance Data Networking**.

The obejective of the course project is to apply different methods (**OpenFlow & P4**) of software-defined networking into the network monitoring application. 

The `report` provides extensive explanations of how we exploit those software-defined networking techniques to loss, throughput, and delay monitoring functionalities.

The implementation of OpenFlow is presented in the code of `OpenFlow.py`.
